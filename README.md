# GymScheduler
My automated scheduler for LA fitness time lots. Quick n dirty

The gym is allowing only 10 people in per hour, and it is insanely competitive. I am horrible at remembering to sign up, so my solution is to have this run automatically
from the windows task scheduler.

It operates with selenium and just goes through the website and gets 'er done. Is this cheating?
